(while on title slide)
- Really great to be back at HMS, have been looking forward to this talk
- Since I was invited by the grad students and this is where I was a grad student, in putting together this talk I have been thinking about how to make it most useful for grad students particularly as well as the greater HMS community. 
- So, not only 'what I wish I'd known' but how to actually do it.  
- In 45 minutes. 

- Since leaving HMS I've begun to identify myself not only as a marine scientist and amateur programmer, but as a data scientist and advocate of open science. 
- I never thought that I would become a data scientist/programmer. I was pretty intimidated by programming.  

- But I've found it to be empowering and complementary to my interests as a marine scientist. I'm hoping to instill this feeling of excitement and empowerment that I have to everyone

## Doing reproducible science

- **Better science in less time**  - *Lowndes et al., in prep*
<br>
    - reproducibility is fundamental, but rarely tested
    - tools have changed how we do science <!--- as much as email did --->
        - reproducibility, collaboration, communication

        - reproducibility, collaboration, communication

<br>

- **Resources and recommendations**
<br>
    - learn to code and use version control
    - exposure to tools and confidence to use them
        - incremental: evolution not revolution 
<!---We find scientists elsewhere are eager to implement open science concepts, but generally have not been exposed to the necessary tools available to suit their needs or lack the knowledge and confidence to begin using them. We've been teaching other scientists--->

## Data science

**Data science**:  

a discipline "to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge"
([*Grolemund & Wickham 2016*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/))

## Conflated questions {.columns-2}

**Science:**

- what is X's habitat preferences?
- when is Y most abundant?
- how wide is their distribution?
<br>
<img src="figures/CTD.png" height="200px" />

**Data science:** 

- how do I import my data?
- how do I subset the years I want?
- how do I visualize this?

## Data science tools

<!---
These are the tools we use and what I mean when I talk about data science and open science tools. 
There are other options out there but these are used by many communities, including Silicon Valley and industry. These things weren't developed for scientists but for coders; we can borrow from what they've learned.

## You can do better science in less time: | Get to your science questions sooner {.columns-2}

**1. Learn to code**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - in [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)  

<!---IDE makes it less intimdating, and so many features for new and seasoned programmers alike--->

**2. Use version control**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/)

<!---It is hard, but it's powerful and isn't that bad. People have blazed these trails and we can build from there ---> 

<!---These help "dispel the misconception that these skills are intuitive, obvious, or in any way inherent"

## Conflating questions {.smaller .columns-2}

**We could reproduce our science questions:** 

- how does X change over time?
- how does X change with Y?
- how to model Z?  

<br>

**Data science:** 

- how to subset just the years we want?
- how to transpose columns to rows?
- how to do this reproducibly?

## OHI Global Assessments

**We expected to easily reproduce our previous work. We had planned ahead:**

- coded models
- 130 pages of published supplemental material
- internal documents and notes
