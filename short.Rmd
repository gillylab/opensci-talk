(while on title slide)
- Really great to be back at HMS, have been looking forward to this talk
- Since I was invited by the grad students and this is where I was a grad student, in putting together this talk I have been thinking about how to make it most useful for grad students particularly as well as the greater HMS community. 
- So, not only 'what I wish I'd known' but how to actually do it.  
- In 45 minutes. 

- Since leaving HMS I've begun to identify myself not only as a marine scientist and amateur programmer, but as a data scientist and advocate of open science. 
- I never thought that I would become a data scientist/programmer. I was pretty intimidated by programming.  

- But I've found it to be empowering and complementary to my interests as a marine scientist. I'm hoping to instill this feeling of excitement and empowerment that I have to everyone

these are pretty familiar to everyone
version control, filesharing, documentation/communication. 
unfortunately, not reproducible. 

We know this first hand because we tried to reproduce our own work and we were extremely challenged.

## Doing reproducible science

- **Better science in less time with open data science tools**
<br>
    - *Lowndes et al., in prep*
    - reproducibility is fundamental, but rarely tested
    - tools have changed how we do science <!--- as much as email did --->
        - reproduciblity, collaboration, communication

- **Resources and recommendations**
<br>
    - learn to code and use version control
    - exposure to tools and confidence to use them
    - evolution not revolution 
<!---We find scientists elsewhere are eager to implement open science concepts, but generally have not been exposed to the necessary tools available to suit their needs or lack the knowledge and confidence to begin using them. We've been teaching other scientists--->

## Data science and open science

**Data science**:

**Open science**:  

"transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers" ([*Hampton et al. 2014*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00402.1/full))

## Open data science tools

<!---
These are the tools we use and what I mean when I talk about data science and open science tools. 
There are other options out there but these are used by many communities, including Silicon Valley and industry. These things weren't developed for scientists but for coders; we can borrow from what they've learned.

<!---
I'm going to talk about 2 main open science tools we use and how I couldn't do my job without them. A whole ecosystem of tools and resources to learn them have been developing since I was here at Hopkins and I wish I had had them. So this isn't going to be a normal science talk but more of the tools we use to make our science more reproducible. 

The punchline is that we as environmental scientists, ecologists can be working more efficiently, collaboratively, and reproducibliy than we are. 
There are existing tools and existing resources to learn them that will greatly improve your science and make you more equipped for future projects and jobs. These tools have changed our approach to science as much as email did. 

We made these changes incrementally over 3.5 years and are still improving; can't be an all-at once thing!  We didn't do this overnight; it was an evolution, not a revolution.

## OHI Global Assessments

**We expected to easily reproduce our previous work. We had planned ahead:**

- coded models
- 130 pages of published supplemental material
- internal documents and notes

## Conflating questions {.smaller .columns-2}

**We could reproduce our science questions:** 

- how does X change over time?
- how does X change with Y?
- how to model Z?  

<br>

**Data science:** 

- how to subset just the years we want?
- how to transpose columns to rows?
- how to do this reproducibly?

## My recommendations | Get to your science questions sooner {.smaller .columns-2}

<figure>

</figure>

<br>
<br>

**1. Learn to code**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - in [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)  

<!---IDE makes it less intimdating, and so many features for new and seasoned programmers alike--->

**2. Use version control**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - through [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)  

<!---What this might mean today is having a lab webpage, and maybe personal webpage, twitter account and a github account --->

**Introduce these concepts incrementally**  

## Great resources {.smaller}

**Books, trainings, and webinars**:

## Learn to program in an intentional way

> - ~~in a panic~~ feeling empowered
- ~~for a single purpose~~ thinking ahead
- ~~in isolation~~ with a community


## Community 

Join existing and create new communities - locally and online

<!---It is hard, but it's powerful and isn't that bad. People have blazed these trails and we can build from there ---> 

<!---These help "dispel the misconception that these skills are intuitive, obvious, or in any way inherent"  
([*Mills 2015*](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/introducing-mozilla-science-study-groups))--->

<!---study groups, community
OHI community
NCEAS community
UCSB community
online community. We put ourselves out there to join the programming community and they have welcomed us

I went from my crazy file structure to being into all of this in a year and a half. It istn't as scary and hard as
