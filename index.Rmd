(while on title slide)
- Really great to be back at HMS, have been looking forward to this talk
- Since I was invited by the grad students and this is where I was a grad student, in putting together this talk I have been thinking about how to make it most useful for grad students particularly as well as the greater HMS community. 
- So, not only 'what I wish I'd known' but how to actually do it.  
- In 45 minutes. 

- Since leaving HMS I've begun to identify myself not only as a marine scientist and amateur programmer, but as a data scientist and advocate of open science. 
- I never thought that I would become a data scientist/programmer. I was pretty intimidated by programming.  

- But I've found it to be empowering and complementary to my interests as a marine scientist. I'm hoping to instill this feeling of excitement and empowerment that I have to everyone

These are the tools we use and what I mean when I talk about data science and open science tools. 
There are other options out there but these are used by many communities, including Silicon Valley and industry. These things weren't developed for scientists but for coders; we can borrow from what they've learned.

I'm going to talk about 2 main open science tools we use and how I couldn't do my job without them. A whole ecosystem of tools and resources to learn them have been developing since I was here at Hopkins and I wish I had had them. So this isn't going to be a normal science talk but more of the tools we use to make our science more reproducible. 

The punchline is that we as environmental scientists, ecologists can be working more efficiently, collaboratively, and reproducibliy than we are. 
There are existing tools and existing resources to learn them that will greatly improve your science and make you more equipped for future projects and jobs. These tools have changed our approach to science as much as email did. 

We made these changes incrementally over 3.5 years and are still improving; can't be an all-at once thing!  We didn't do this overnight; it was an evolution, not a revolution.

- how fast and far can they migrate?
- how do they interact with other species? 
- how do I work with data that's too big for Excel?
- how do I subset years or other attributes?

## OHI Global Assessments

<!---
- Assess coastlines of nations and territories
- Lots of data, ranging from categorical tabular data to high resolution rasters - from nearly one hundred freely available, existing sources

- We were planning to repeat the global assessment annually and also support other groups that wanted to lead their own assessments. 

- highly collaborative

We expected to easily reproduce our previous work. We had planned ahead:

- coded models
- 130 pages of published supplemental material

## Reproducibility - data preparation 

*"Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing data, before it can be explored for useful information." - [NYTimes (2014)](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html)*

- transforming, rescaling, gap-filling, formatting, renaming, etc.
- seldom mentioned but underpins the scientific process

**Before**

- manually (without coding)
- largely Microsoft Excel

- full process coded 
    - R with documentation

Philosophy of data wrangling
<br>
[Grolemund & Wickham 2016: *R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading-and-gathering)

- reduces potential for error
- these things took me forever to do and now there's one command
- talk about philosophy: some ways are better than others. Resources available for packages, tidyverse

## Reproducibility - version control

**Before**

- filenames suffixed with dates, initials 
    - e.g. `final.csv` and `final_JL-2016-08-05.csv`
- email descriptions of what changed between files

**After**

- version control with `git`
- short messages accompany committed changes

record of history

--->

<!---Redesigning our team's workflow required a substantial time investment to learn the tools, and a paradigm shift in our approach to collaboration. Previous to this investment, most team members with any coding experience had learned just enough to accomplish specific tasks (not necessarily in R), and had developed unique conventions. Given the complexity of the project, we needed to learn to code collaboratively and incorporate best practices into our coding25 so that methods for data preparation and modeling could be co-developed and vetted by multiple team members. Further, using a version control system allowed individuals to feel less inhibited about their coding contributions, since files could always be reverted back to previous versions if there were problems.

email chains or memory. This lack of transparency and repeatability was even more problematic for new team members--->

## My recommendations | Get to your science questions sooner {.smaller .columns-2}

<br>
<br>

**1. Learn to code**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - in [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)  

<!---IDE makes it less intimdating, and so many features for new and seasoned programmers alike--->

**2. Use version control**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - through [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)  

<!---What this might mean today is having a lab webpage, and maybe personal webpage, twitter account and a github account --->

**Introduce these concepts incrementally**  

## Great resources {.smaller}
