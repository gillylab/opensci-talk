(while on title slide)
- Really great to be back at HMS, have been looking forward to this talk
- In the last few years I've begun to identify myself not only as a marine scientist and amateur programmer, but as a data scientist and advocate of open science. 

I never thought that I would become a data scientist/programmer. I was pretty intimidated by programming.  But from my own experience, as well as through teaching other scientists how to program, the main barriers for scientists becoming competent programmers are exposure and confidence. 

This is not a typical research talk but I'm going to share some of what I and my team has learned, and I'm hoping this talk will empower everyone; give you exposure and build confidence

## Outline

- **My origins in programming, data science, and open science**
<br>
<!---I think this will resonate with you.  --->

- **Improving reproducibility, collaboration and communication in environmental science with open science tools**
<br>
    - *Lowndes et al., in prep*
    - reproducibility is fundamental to science, but rarely tested
    - these tools have fundamentally changed how we do science <!--- as much as email did --->

- **Resources and recommendations**
    - exposure and confidence: learning the tools available and using them

<!---We find scientists elsewhere are eager to implement open science concepts, but generally have not been exposed to the necessary tools available to suit their needs or lack the knowledge and confidence to begin using them. We've been teaching other scientists--->

## Data science and open science

**Data Science**:  

"an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge"

**Open Science**:  

"the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers" ([*Hampton et al. 2014*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00402.1/full))


<!--- 
With open science tools, in some ways the benefits of openness are a byproduct of introducing time-saving efficiencies to improve scientific workflows
these tools reduce the headaches that accompany many data-rich workflows, and as a bonus, the resulting science is more transparent, reproducible, and accessible.-

<!---
I'm going to talk about 2 main open science tools we use and how I couldn't do my job without them. A whole ecosystem of tools and resources to learn them have been developing since I was here at Hopkins and I wish I had had them. So this isn't going to be a normal science talk but more of the tools we use to make our science more reproducible. 

The punchline is that we as environmental scientists, ecologists can be working more efficiently, collaboratively, and reproducibliy than we are. 
There are existing tools and existing resources to learn them that will greatly improve your science and make you more equipped for future projects and jobs. These tools have changed our approach to science as much as email did. 

We made these changes incrementally over 3.5 years and are still improving; can't be an all-at once thing!  We didn't do this overnight; it was an evolution, not a revolution.

## Some thesis questions 

> - what are Humboldt squid habitat preferences?
- what season are they most abundant?
- how fast and far can they migrate?
- how do they interact with other species? 
- how do I import my data when it's too big for Excel?
- how do I subset years or other attributes?
- how do I visualize this?
- how on earth do I even think about this?

## OHI Global Assessments

<!---
- Assess coastlines of nations and territories
- Lots of data, ranging from categorical tabular data to high resolution rasters - from nearly one hundred freely available, existing sources

- We were planning to repeat the global assessment annually and also support other groups that wanted to lead their own assessments. 

- highly collaborative

We expected to easily reproduce our previous work. We had planned ahead: 

<!--- standard approaches to marine science/reproduciblity --->

- coded models
- 130 pages of published supplemental material
- internal documents and notes

## We thought we were doing reproducible science

We struggled to reproduce our work using standard approaches to reproducibility and collaboration 
<!---The effort to develop the first global OHI assessment was highly collaborative, which created additional challenges beyond data preparation. --->

- added challenge of managing multiple years of information and scores 
- we needed a nimble approach to sharing data, methods, and results within and outside our team 


## We identified three main challenges to overcome

1) **reproducibility**, including transparency and repeatability, esp. data prep
2) **collaboration**, including teamwork and internal collaboration
3) **communication** with scientific and public communities

<!---large, distributed team structure, division of labor--->

<!---I'm just going to give an example or two of each; will describe before and after; happy to discuss more afters and will let you read the paper when it comes out--->

## Reproducibility - data preparation 

*"Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing data, before it can be explored for useful information." - [NYTimes (2014)](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html)*

- transforming, rescaling, gap-filling, formatting, etc.
- seldom mentioned but underpins the scientific process

--->

<!---Redesigning our team's workflow required a substantial time investment to learn the tools, and a paradigm shift in our approach to collaboration. Previous to this investment, most team members with any coding experience had learned just enough to accomplish specific tasks (not necessarily in R), and had developed unique conventions. Given the complexity of the project, we needed to learn to code collaboratively and incorporate best practices into our coding25 so that methods for data preparation and modeling could be co-developed and vetted by multiple team members. Further, using a version control system allowed individuals to feel less inhibited about their coding contributions, since files could always be reverted back to previous versions if there were problems.

email chains or memory. This lack of transparency and repeatability was even more problematic for new team members--->

## My recommendations | Learn to program the right way

> - ~~in a panic~~ feeling empowered
- ~~for a single purpose~~ thinking ahead
- ~~in isolation~~ with a community

## My recommendations | You've had a bit of exposure of these tools. Next: build confidence.

**1 - Learn to code** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - in [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)  

<!---IDE makes it less intimdating, and so many features for new and seasoned programmers alike--->

**2 - Use version control**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - with [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - through [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)  

<!---What this might mean today is having a lab webpage, and maybe personal webpage, twitter account and a github account --->
**Introduce these concepts incrementally: evolution not revolution**  


## Great resources {.smaller}

**Books, trainings, and webinars**: 

- [ohi-science.org/news: Resources for R and Data Science](http://ohi-science.org/news/Resources-for-R-and-Data-Science)

<br>
<br>
**Recent academic publications**: 

- "How open science helps researchers succeed" ([*McKiernan et al. 2016*](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800v2))
- "Best Practices for Scientific Computing" ([*Wilson et al. 2014*](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745))
- "Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing" ([*Wilson et al. 2016*](https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/))

<br>
<br>

These help "dispel the misconception that these skills are intuitive, obvious, or in any way inherent"  
([*Mills 2015*](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/introducing-mozilla-science-study-groups))
